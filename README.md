# Getting Started

A very basic project showing how to initialize our library and render a solution on the map

## Usage

Clone the project and open it in Android Studio.

## Requirements

First, you need to generate a google maps key for android (follow the instructions here [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup)). Once you get the key, open the file "[google_maps_api.xml](./app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml)" (under  "res/values"), then replace __"YOUR_KEY_HERE"__ with it.
